** DRAFT -- Needs testing and verfication **

To create your own customaized careers, go in to the lib subdirectory and
copy CareerTemplate.rb to whatever name you want. Mostly. Ruby needs Class 
names to start with an uppercase Alpha character, and the program may not 
deal well with exotic names. 

Read the notes that are in your new career file, the process is explained step
by step. Refer to other careers if you need ideas.

Edit bin/Chargen.rb to add your career to the "available_careers" array.

The program is usually called with:
 ruby lib/Chargen.rb [-t <terms>] [-c <career>]

If you create a Spacer career and want to create a 4 term NPC, use:
  ruby lib/Chargen.rb -t 4 -c Spacer
