** DRAFT -- Needs testing and verfication **

To create your own customized careers, go in to the lib subdirectory and
copy CareerTemplate.rb to whatever name you want. Mostly. Ruby needs Class 
names to start with an uppercase Alpha character, and the program may not 
deal well with exotic names. 

Read the notes that are in your new career file, the process is explained 
step by step. Refer to other careers if you need ideas.

Copy test/tc_Mycareer.rb to a file for your new career. 
  You can run the test case by itself. If successful, add it to
  ts_CT_Character_Generator.rb.

    ruby test/tc_Mycareer.rb
    ruby test/ts_CT_Character_Generator.rb

Edit bin/Chargen.rb to add your career to the "available_careers" array.

The program is usually called with:
 ruby bin/Chargen.rb [-t <terms>] [-c <career>]

For example, if you create a Spacer career and want to create a 4 term
  NPC, use:
  ruby lib/Chargen.rb -t 4 -c Spacer
