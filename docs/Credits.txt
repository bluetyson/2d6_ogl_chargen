Character Temperaments are based off the Keirsey's work.

Character Plots come from a variety of wiki sources for the various
number of plots. 

Character Traits are from the books "The Positive Trait Thesaurus: 
A Writer's Guide to Character Attributes" and "The Negative Trait 
Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide to Character Flaws" by Angela Ackerman 
and Becca Puglisi. I recommend both books highly if you want to 
develop depth in your characters. The authors expand on how each trait
affects behavior, thought, and what it might grow into.
