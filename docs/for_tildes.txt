Hey, I appreciate you looking at my code. Feel free to suggest ways
to improve.

Sample run from the base directory:

  ruby bin/Chargen.rb -c Navy -t 4

The code currently requires SQLite and JSON. I'm moving to make those 
optional.

A high level code overview is in docs/class_structure_version_2.txt

I'm currently working on better and cleaner Objects and OOP.
