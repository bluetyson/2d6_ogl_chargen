CT_Character_Generator
======================

This provides mechanisms for creating "Classic Traveller" (LBB 1-8)
characters. It currently uses Ruby 1.8, SQLite3, and JSON. 

RDoc files are in the doc directory. Architectures and assumptions are
in the docs directory. Probably need to clean that up. 

Traveller (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)) 
is a Role-Playing Game copyright Far Future Enterprises 
(http://farfuture.net). 

This code is copyright Leam Hall (https://github.com/LeamHall) and 
is open for free fair use.

The older code is available in the oldstable branch.
